Package cmmutil provides Commercium-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.

This package was developed for cmmd, a full-node implementation of Commercium which
is under active development by Commercium Team.  Although it was primarily written for
cmmd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a
standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.
